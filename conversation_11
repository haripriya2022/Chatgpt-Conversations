User: Hello! I live in Pueblla and i must go for a internship to 1 of 3 places. I need to shop around a little as i have very little money. can you aid me with this task
Wizard: Sure! Do you mean puebla?
User: yes, but i want to go to Seoul 
Wizard: Do you need to be there for specific dates?
User: aug 30 to sept 12
Wizard: I'm sorry, we do not have flights to Seoul on those dates. What other cities are you considering?
User: Chicago do u have something cheap there
Wizard: The best option I can offer you leaves August 31st. Are your dates flexible at all?
User: August 31 is fine i can leave bit later
Wizard: Great! Then you could stay at the Sierra Inn & Suites from August 31st to September 17th. It is only a 2 star hotel, but it would only cost you 413.32USD.
User: Sounds good but any way I can come back before 17
Wizard: Yes, I have another package at the same hotel from August 31st to September 12th. This one would cost you 427.42USD.
User: is there wifi at this hotel i will need that for my project
Wizard: Yes! There is free wifi, breakfast and parking.
User: i like this package very much but i must check for packages in north vancouver too
Wizard: We currently do not have flights to North Vancouver on the dates that you need.
User: so i guess iw ill go with best deal Sierra Inn from Aug 31 to Sept 12. I travel alone- do you know if it is safe neighbourhood?
Wizard: I'm afraid I do not have that information. All I can tell you is that it is close to a park and to the airport.
