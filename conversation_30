User: Hello. Oh my next destination is my home.. as soon as I get off work
If I ever get off ....
But you know where I would really love to go?
Somewhere with sun.. anywhere really
Cleveland is so grey and dead this time of year
I've been dreaming of going down to South America
Would I ever be able to get to Campinas from here with 5200 dollars?
Wizard: Sure can! You can go for up to 14 days to a 3.5 star hotel in the heart of Campinas, close to the mall and cathedral.
User: Get out! How much would that cost me... hypothetically
Wizard: 3355.13 with economy flights and just 4335.7 for an upgrade to business class.
User: :heart_eyes: Would I be able to afford a trip to Rio de Janeiro?
Wizard: Yes you can. You can afford to stay up to 16 days at a 3.0 star hotel near the park, museum, and university.
User: Would I have amenities included? What would I pay for that one?
Wizard: The hotel's got everything covered! With free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. The economy seats will cost you 4144.38.
User: Impressive!! Now, I may be being greedy here..
If I was to keep my sunshine spree domestic
And went to Atlanta..
I'm wondering if I could be under budget enough that I'd have enough left over for maybe another trip
Wizard: That is actually very possible. For a 10 day stay in a 3.5 star beachside hotel, it will just be 1283.2 in business class and 962.67 in economy class.
User: Wow!! Sweet! Well I am still stuck at work, as you know
So I can't book anything
But I appreciate you entertaining me this evening
