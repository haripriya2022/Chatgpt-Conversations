User: and if i were to leave from columbus?
Wizard: From Columbus, I have  flights available to Toronto or Vancouver.
User: what do we have for Toronto?
Wizard: From Toronto I have packages available to Calgary or Vancouver. I am only showing the cheapest packages. Perhaps if you give me your budget, I can find other more exciting destinations.
User: i have a budget of $3000, and letâ€™s say that i leave from Mexico City
Wizard: I apologize, but leaving from Mexico City, the only available destinations are Toronto or Vancouver. Perhaps if we change your dates?
