User: Hello! I am located in Germany and I'm getting married next month, We would really like to go to Naples . can you find me a nice package please!
Wizard: Good day! I can book you a 14-day stay in the Tower Hotel from the 2nd to the 15th of September. Your flight would leave from Frankfurt. How does that sound?
User: We need to leave from Hamburg. Do you have anything leaving on August 30th? We have a week off then and don't really want to change our vacation time. We are also on a budget cause this wedding cost us a fortune so try to find us a real deal please.
Wizard: It looks like I do have a flight from Hamburg to Naples. I can book you a room in the Tower Hotel from the second to the seventh of September. The best deal I can offer you on this package is 1232.50USD. Do you want me to book this trip?
User: The 2nd to the 7th of September is not good for us. How about  Vitoria? Do you have anything in Vitoria leaving on August 18th?
Wizard: If you're leaving from Vitoria, I could book you a flight which leaves on the 19th of August. Would you like to hear more about this package?
User: No, I would leave from Hamburg still...and go to Vitoria. We have $1800.00. What can you do for us? I apologize but it needs to be around August 30th.
Wizard: My apologies for the misunderstanding. The closest day I could give you for a flight from Hamburg to Vitoria would be the second of September. You would be returning the following week on the seventh. Would you like to hear more about this package? It is well within your budget.
User: I suppose a couple of days later is fine, it will give us a chance to recover from the wedding! Yes, please give me more information!
Wizard: Of course! You would be staying for 6 nights at the Hotel Oro, a 3-star hotel with a 0/10 guest rating which offers free breakfast, fre wifi and parking. Your flight would leave from Hamburg on Friday, September 6th at 10:56a.m. The total cost of this package is 771.36 USD. Would you like me to book this package?
User: I thought our flight departed on September 2nd?
Wizard: My apologies, you are correct. Your flight departs on Friday, September 2nd at 10:56a.m. Would you like me to book this package?
User: Hold your horse! It sounds like a great deal but I need to check with my bride first. I will get back to you.  Thank you for your help.
