User: Hi! We are getting married in beautiful Cleveland underneath the redwoods next weekend. We've been soooooo busy we forgot about the honeymoon! Do you have any last minute special to Porto?
Wizard: Yes, I do! What dates would you like to travel? Do you have a budget? Will there be just two of you travelling for your honeymoon?
User: The wedding is on the 23rd so it has the be the 24th or after. We are hoping for a week in Porto. We finally get some time, just the 2 of us!
Wizard: ok, great! I have 4 different hotels you can stay at. Would you like to hear about the 4.0 star hotel first?
User: Yes, it's our honeymoon after all! But we only have $5100 to spend.
Wizard: Unfortunately I have nothing available within your budget :disappointed:
User: how about a lower end hotel then :disappointed:
Wizard: Sadly the cheapest in Porto for your dates is around 7000. Anywhere else I could look into for you?
User: No we can only go to Porto... or Porto. Thanks.
