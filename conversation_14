User: Finally get to take a vacation! I'm looking for trips leaving from Nagoya
What do you have going to Rome?
Wizard: Letâ€™s see what I can offer you! When are you planning on taking your trip?
User: Anytime between August 30th and the 13th of September
Wizard: In that case I can offer you the Secret Bay from Sept 2-8 for $2628.
User: Sounds like a cool hotel! Is it fancy?
Wizard: The hotel is not yet rated.
User: ok, how about if I went to Porto Alegre?
Wizard: Wait, I also have a 4 star hotel in Rome. The Hotel Emerald Legacy offers free wifi and breakfast, is located near a cathedral, and would cost just about 3000 dollars for an 8 days package.
User: oh cool! what was included in the other one?
Wizard: Secret Bay also features free wifi and breakfast
User: so where could I stay in Porto?
Wizard: 12 days at the Breakwater Hotel in Porto would run you 4674.68USD. The hotel is 3.5 stars and features free wifi and free breakfast!
User: would Seattle be cheaper?
Wizard: 13 days at the Fairyland in Seattle would cost you 2759.69USD.
User: not bad! I forgot to ask, is the one in Porto close to anything interesting?
Wizard: Not that I can tell.
User: how about the seattle one?
Wizard: It's right in the heart of the city
User: I've also been dreaming of Kyoto
Wizard: Leaving Nagoya, 7 days in Kyoto could cost you as low as 153.17USD
User: including breakfast?
Wizard: Of course!
User: Which hotels have good user reviews?
Wizard: Quiet Garden Resort in Kochi has 8.22/10 user review. That would cost 527 USD for a 7 days stay. Also available would be the Southern Palace Hotel with a user rating of 6.61. 11 days at this hotel would cost you $539.
User: I meant among all the hotels you offered
Wizard: The Fairyland has 0/10, Breakwater has 8.8/10, Secret Bay has 0/10, and Emerald Legacy has 8.22/10.

Wizard: Ok. Pick one.
User: How many stars does Fairyland have?
Wizard: 3.5
User: with breakfast? :smile:
